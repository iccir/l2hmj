Subject: [l2h] New release of latex2html? 

Hi,

at Debian, we found that there is

http://mirrors.ctan.org/support/latex2html/latex2html-2012.tgz

which wasn't announced as an official new release. See also

http://bugs.debian.org/647433

Now I wonder if I should use this as the new official "upstream" version
to be built upon from now on? There are some doubts that I collected in
the above Debian bug report.

Any remarks?

Thanks in advance,

Roland
